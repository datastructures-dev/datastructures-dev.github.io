An alternative algorithm called Breath-First search provides us with the ability to return the same results as DFS but with the added guarantee to return the shortest-path first.

Rules of BFS Algorithm

    A queue (FIFO-First in First Out) data structure is used by BFS.
    You mark any node in the graph as root and start traversing the data from it.
    BFS traverses all the nodes in the graph and keeps dropping them as completed.
    BFS visits an adjacent unvisited node, marks it as done, and inserts it into a queue.
    Removes the previous vertex from the queue in case no adjacent vertex is found.
    BFS algorithm iterates until all the vertices in the graph are successfully traversed and marked as completed.
    There are no loops caused by BFS during the traversing of data from any node.
