Linear Search is a very simple method for searching a list for a particular value. It is also called as sequential search, as it works by comparing the value to be searched sequentially with every element of the list one by one until a match is found.

It is worst searching algorithm with worst case time complexity O (n).

Performance 

The best case of linear search algorithm is when VAL is equal to the first element of the list. In this case, only one comparison will be made.

The worst case will happen when either VAL is not present in the array or it is equal to the last element of the list. In both the cases, n comparisons will have to be made.

    Start from the leftmost element of given arr[] and one by one compare element x with each element of arr[]
    If x matches with any of the element, return the index value.
    If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements in arr[] , return -1 or element not found.
