In This File is the text and information that would be displayed on the BinarySearch page i cannot implement it in as i don't understand JavaScript and don't want to mess with it. 



Binary Search works on sorted arrays. Large data companies like Twitter, facebook often use binary search on their hash tables to find the data quickly. The binary search algorithm works as follows:

    * Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the array with the target value.
    * If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the array is returned.
    * If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array.
    * If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.

Performance

  Worst Case Performance: O(log(n))
  Best Case Performance: O(1)
  Average Case Performance: O(log(n))
  Worst Case Space Complexity: O(1)

Binary Search Pseudo Code

Let an array A with n elements with values sorted in ascending order and a target value T. The following subroutine will be used to find the index of T in A.

    Set L to 0 and R to n-1
    If L > R search is Unsuccessful
    Set m to the floor of ((L+R) / 2),
    If A[m] < T, set L = m + 1, and goto step 2.
    If A[m] > T, set R = m – 1, and goto step 2.
    If A[m] == T, Voila!! Search is done, return m

function binary_search(A, n, T):
    L := 0
    R := n − 1
    while L <= R:
        m := floor((L + R) / 2)
        if A[m] < T:
            L := m + 1
        else if A[m] > T:
            R := m - 1
        else:
            return m
    return unsuccessful
